# SlackCodingChallenge

This is a sample app using Slack APIs, speficically https://slack.com/api/users.list for an interview coding challenge

The app gets the response from the users.list API and displays a list of users in a test Slack team.
Clicking on a specific user list item will open a more detailed profile page of the selected user.
